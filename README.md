## General Information

Lorem ipsum

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2
- `make`, `git`

Everything the pipeline needs (Python, dbt, DuckDB CLI) is bundled inside the image. No host-side Python setup required.

Notebook exploration (`notebooks/`) uses jupyterlab + pandas + pyarrow. Those are dev-only and kept out of the image — install them into a local venv if you need to re-run the notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.6.3 pandas==2.2.3 pyarrow==17.0.0
```

## Installation

```bash
make install     # builds the docker image
```

## Build

```bash
make check       # prove the wiring: lists the declared dbt sources
make build       # run all dbt models and tests
make shell       # open duckdb CLI on the warehouse (inside container)
make help        # list all targets
```
